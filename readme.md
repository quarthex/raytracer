# raytracer

This is a straightforward Rust port of the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_][rotw]
raytracer.

# The final render

For the final render, my code samples every ray 500 times. It took almost 2.5
hours to render on my 2018 i7 MacBook Pro. (I'm not sure if that's fast or slow,
but I'm working to find out.)
